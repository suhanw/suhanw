# Hi, I'm Suhan 🖖🏻 

![Hero Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suhanw/suhanw/master/assets/bg.jpeg)

I'm a right-brained technologist with a passion for coding, product, and UX. When I'm not coding, I go on fun adventures with my wife and son.

I work at [Boxed.com](https://www.boxed.com) as the Growth Tech Lead. Check us out for your cleaning essentials, or other grocery needs (in bulk!).

Hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suhanwijaya/) or [email](mailto:suhanw@gmail.com)!
